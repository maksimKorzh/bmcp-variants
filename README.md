# BMCP: chess variants
This is the didactic proof of concept implementation of a bare minimum chess engine<br>
and GUI I've developed to help people learning the very gist of chess programming.<br>
This work is dedicated to hobby programmers who eventually want to come up with<br>
their own programs playing either standard chess or chess variants. Every chess variant<br>
presented here is available as a single stand-alone heavily commented javascript source<br>
file that can run locally in the browser on computer or mobile device. Some nitty gritty<br>
rules are dropped for simplicity and clarity. All the features and limitations regarding<br>
a particular chess variant are listed below. The entire engine is the single function that<br>
takes board position as an input and outputs best move found within a fixed depth search.<br>
